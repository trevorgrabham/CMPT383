1. The Output type is necessary because we need to know that all of our tasks that are 
    being completed can be handled in the same fashion once they are returned. Otherwise, 
    we could have multiple tasks returning completely different results
2. We cannot use iter, because workers was not made mutable. Vec drain creates 
    a new object that allows us to remove the values from the workers without this
3. we need a clone, because we need to be able to move a memory reference from whatever 
    object will end up being the data for our Arc, so we pass a clone instead, since we 
    only need to read from the block, not update it
